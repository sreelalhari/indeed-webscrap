Backstory:
The journey of Locus from being a women's safety application to a leading logistics optimization platform, is an interesting one. In 2015, Nishith Rastogi and Geet Garg developed RideSafe, a women's safety geo-tracking app to track deviations from pre-defined ride routes.
It was soon adopted by food tech companies to track deviations of their delivery staff. This gave Nishith and Geet material insight that there was clearly a lack of a decision-making system in logistics. This realization was the pivotal foresight that led to the building of Locus, an end-to-end dispatch planning and route optimization platform for supply chain enterprises.
From 2015 till date , Locus has grown by leaps and bounds, with a clear focus on innovating consistently
